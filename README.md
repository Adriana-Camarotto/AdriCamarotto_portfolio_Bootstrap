## Usage

It is possible to use the navigation bar at the top of the website to acess links to main sections, like home, my skills and work section.

Users can also acess the dropdown button in the nav bar, which will take them to my social medias to know me better.

On the Skills section users can not only see what are my skilss, but also, acess my Linkedin using the "follow me in Linkedin" button at the Skils section.

Finally, To acess all my works the users can use the Github button on the home page.
